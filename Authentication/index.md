# Authentication vulnerabilities

Conceptually at least, authentication vulnerabilities are some of the simplest issues to understand. However, they can be among the most critical due to the obvious relationship between authentication and security. As well as potentially allowing attackers direct access to sensitive data and functionality, they also expose additional attack surface for further exploits. For this reason, learning how to identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities, including how to bypass common protection measures, is a fundamental skill.

In this section, we'll look at some of the most common authentication mechanisms used by websites and discuss potential vulnerabilities in them. We'll highlight both inherent vulnerabilities in different authentication mechanisms, as well as some typical vulnerabilities that are introduced by their improper implementation.
